# Space Struts

## Goals
  - Gain understanding of spacial architecture
  - Geometry can be introduced to younger students because of the hands on nature will allow the easy transfer of mental creativity into tangible geometric based forms.
  - Facilitate learning with an easy to manipulate form factor for immediate feedback and learning
  - Provide a mathematically complete architectural grid for very large structures away from gravity’s influence
  - Provide a way to build temporary structures suitable for open market stalls, greenhouses, coops

## Concept:
  -  Basic concepts in geometry are glossed over and ignored in our current mathematical training.  This is not to say the methods given are faulty, but that the focus of that mathematics has been on computing some specific numerical value, rather than giving a gateway to translate creative geometric abstractions into concrete, physical objects.
  -  Space Struts does that in an incredibly simple way.  Specifically, Space Struts uses only two basic shapes: the Golden Triangle and the Golden Gnomon. Physically, these will be triangles made of paper straws for casual, small scale construction (similar to toy building blocks), and triangles made of bent rebar for larger, real-world construction.

### Unanswered challenges
  Best physical implementations:
    ⁃ Small factor for hobbies and educational use
    ⁃ Large factor for temporary structures
    ⁃ Space factor for very large structures
