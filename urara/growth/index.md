summary: scaling up is easy
---

Two triangles make the next size up of the Gnomon, and three triangles to get to the next larger Golden Triangle.  This scaling ability continues on forever with the number of triangles in these scaled sizes being 2,3,5,8,13,21…: a sequence that is directly the result of the Fibonacci sequence.

As long the rule “always connect short to short and long to long, we can have a consistent pattern.  However, in two dimensions, this can lead to seeming incompatibilities like this:
