Folding four can create a shape known as a disphenoid.  Every acute triangle (not just isosceles) can make a similar shape by folding along the bisectors of the edges of the triangle.  

However, the Golden Gnomon is an obtuse triangle and a Simao shape does not exist.  The least number of Golden Gnomons to fit together are six.  There are two:

In the Space Struts these are the two basic shapes that define three dimensional space, especially when gravity is absent, making the concept of “down” meaningless.

Right-handed coordinate system with red, green and blue assigned to the same axes
The orange vertices lie at (±1, ±1, ±1) and form a cube (dotted lines).

The red vertices lie at (±ϕ, ±

ϕ
, 0) and form a rectangle on the xy-plane.
The green vertices lie at (0, ±ϕ, ±
1
ϕ
) and form a rectangle on the yz-plane.
The blue vertices lie at (±
1
ϕ
, 0, ±ϕ) and form a rectangle on the xz-plane.
(The red, green and blue coordinate triples are circular permutations of each other.)

The distance between adjacent vertices is 
2

, and the distance from the origin to any vertex is √3.

ϕ =

 is the golden ratio.

### Unanswered challenges
  Best physical implementations:
    ⁃ Small factor for hobbies and educational use
    ⁃ Large factor for temporary structures
    ⁃ Space factor for very large structures
